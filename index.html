                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p> Hello everyone! My name is Jessica Findlay. I have been a dental hygienist for 13 years. I am craving more creativity
                    and growth. After years of brainstorming, I decided I would like to become a web developer. 
                    It has been challenging thus far, but exciting to learn something new and useful. Like any job,
                    it takes time to learn and master. In my spare time I enjoy hanging out with my dog named Cody, 
                    hiking, biking, running, traveling, and yoga. In fact, I went to Costa Rica in May 2018 for two weeks
                    to become a certified yoga instructor. I hope to travel to India one day to study some more. </p>
